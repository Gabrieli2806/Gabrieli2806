## Hi 👋 I'm Gabriel

I'm a developer who enjoys building Minecraft mods, plugins, and backend systems. I like working on projects where I can turn ideas into something functional and well-structured.

### 🔧 What I do
- Minecraft mods (client, server, hybrid)
- Plugins and server-side tools
- Backend and infrastructure work
