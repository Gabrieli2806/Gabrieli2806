## Hi 👋 I'm Gabriel

I'm a developer focused on building **Minecraft mods, plugins, and backend systems**. Functional, and well-structured projects.

I usually work on things that sit between **gameplay and systems engineering** — making tools that are useful, efficient, and scalable.

### 🔧 What I do

* Minecraft mods (Fabric / Forge / NeoForge, client, server, hybrid)
* Minecraft plugins (BungeeCord / PaperMC, server-side systems)
* Server tooling and developer utilities

### 🚀 Projects & interests

* Custom Minecraft mods focused on convenience and QoL
* Cross-server systems and shared player features
* Hosting platforms and backend-heavy game services
* Clean APIs, maintainable code, and good architecture

### 🛠 Tech I commonly use

* Java / Kotlin / C++
* Fabric API, Bukkit, BungeeCord
* Docker, Linux servers
* Databases & REST-style APIs

I’m always experimenting and improving existing ideas rather than just building things for show.
